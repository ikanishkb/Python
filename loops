    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(i)

6)  Given a number ‘num’, find its factorial.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
fact = 1
for i in range (num,0,-1):
    fact = fact*i
print(fact)

(using while loop)
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
fact = 1
while num != 0:
    fact *= num
    num = num - 1
print(fact)

7) Given two integers a and b, find the value of a raised to power b.
a = int(input("Enter 1st num: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2nd num: "))
result = 1
for i in range(b):
    result *= a
print (result)

8) Write a program to print multiplication table (upto 10) of any number saved in variable ‘num’.
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range (1,11):
    print(a," * ",i," = ", a*i)

9) Write a program to check whether a number is Prime number or not.
num = 6
flag = True
for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
    if num % i == 0:
        flag = False
        break

if flag:
    print("prime")
else:
    print("not prime")

10) Write a program to print all Prime numbers between 1 and 100
for i in range(2, 101):
    flag = True
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            flag = False
            break
    if flag:
        print(i)

11) Ask user to enter a command. If the command is not “x” print the command and ask for the next command. Keep repeating, until the user enters “x”.
cmd = input("Enter a command: ")
while cmd != "x":
    print(cmd)
    cmd = input("Enter a command: ")

12) Take N as input. If the number is prime, print “Prime” otherwise print “Not Prime”.
a = int(input("Enter the number to be checked: "))
flag = True
if a==1:
    print("wrong input")
else:
    for i in range(2,int(a**0.5)+1):
        if a % i == 0 :
            flag=False
            break
    if flag:
        print("prime")
    else:
        print("not prime")

13) Take N as input. Print all prime numbers from 2 to N
N = int(input("Enter a number:"))
for i in range(2, N):
    flag = True
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            flag = False
            break
    if flag:
        print(i)

14)  Take N as input. Calculate and print its reverse. Ex: 3247 will output 7423
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
revnum = 0
while num != 0:
    x = int(num % 10)
    num = num // 10
    revnum = (revnum * 10) + x
print(revnum)

15) Take N as input. Print the sum of its odd placed digits and sum of its even placed digits.
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
revnum = 0
oddsum = 0
evensum = 0
cnt = 0

while num != 0:
    x = int(num % 10)
    num = num // 10
    revnum = (revnum * 10) + x

while revnum != 0:
    x = int(revnum % 10)
    cnt = cnt + 1
    revnum = revnum // 10

    if int(cnt % 2) == 0:
        evensum += x
    else:
        oddsum += x

print("Sum of odd places: ", oddsum)
print("Sum of even places: ", evensum)

16) Take N as input. Print Nth Fibonacci number
x = 0
y = 1
i=1
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
while i < num:
    temp = x
    x = x + y
    y = temp
    i+=1
print(x)

17) Take N as input. Print all Fibonacci numbers less than N.
x = 0
y = 1
i = 1
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(x)
while i < num:
    temp = x
    x = x + y
    y = temp
    print(x)
    i+=1
